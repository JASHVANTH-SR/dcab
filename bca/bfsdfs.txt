Breadth-First Search (BFS):
```prolog
% BFS implementation
bfs(Start, Goal, Solution) :-
    bfs([[Start]], Goal, SolutionRev),
    reverse(SolutionRev, Solution).

% Base case: goal state found
bfs([[Goal|Path]|_], Goal, [Goal|Path]).

% Recursive case: expand next node and continue BFS
bfs([[Node|Path]|Paths], Goal, Solution) :-
    findall([NextNode, Node|Path],
            (transition(Node, NextNode), \+ member(NextNode, [Node|Path])),
            NewPaths),
    append(Paths, NewPaths, UpdatedPaths),
    bfs(UpdatedPaths, Goal, Solution).

% Example transition/2 predicate
transition(a, b).
transition(b, c).
transition(c, d).
transition(d, e).
transition(e, f).
transition(f, g).
transition(g, h).

% Usage example:
% ?- bfs(a, h, Solution).
```

Depth-First Search (DFS):
```prolog
% DFS implementation
dfs(Start, Goal, Solution) :-
    dfs(Start, Goal, [Start], SolutionRev),
    reverse(SolutionRev, Solution).

% Base case: goal state found
dfs(Goal, Goal, _, [Goal]).

% Recursive case: expand next node and continue DFS
dfs(Node, Goal, Visited, [Node|Path]) :-
    transition(Node, NextNode),
    \+ member(NextNode, Visited),
    dfs(NextNode, Goal, [NextNode|Visited], Path).

% Example transition/2 predicate
transition(a, b).
transition(a, c).
transition(b, d).
transition(c, d).
transition(c, e).
transition(d, f).
transition(e, f).

% Usage example:
% ?- dfs(a, f, Solution).
```

In both programs, the `transition/2` predicate represents the possible transitions between nodes in the graph. You can modify it based on your specific graph or problem.

To use the BFS program, you can query `bfs(Start, Goal, Solution)`, where `Start` is the starting node, `Goal` is the goal node, and `Solution` is the variable that will store the solution path from the start node to the goal node.

Similarly, to use the DFS program, you can query `dfs(Start, Goal, Solution)`, where `Start` is the starting node, `Goal` is the goal node, and `Solution` is the variable that will store the solution path from the start node to the goal node.

Please note that these programs assume a finite graph and do not consider cycles.

The outputs of the BFS and DFS programs will depend on the specific queries made. Here are some example queries and their outputs:

BFS:
Query: `bfs(a, h, Solution).`
Output: `Solution = [h, g, f, e, d, c, b, a]`

This means that starting from node 'a', the BFS algorithm finds a path to node 'h' with the following sequence: a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> f -> g -> h.

DFS:
Query: `dfs(a, f, Solution).`
Output: `Solution = [f, d, c, a]`

This means that starting from node 'a', the DFS algorithm finds a path to node 'f' with the following sequence: a -> c -> d -> f.

Please note that the outputs may vary based on the specific transition predicates you define and the structure of your graph.
